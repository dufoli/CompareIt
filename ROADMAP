Specification of compareIt:

Goal: produce a little website which provide the ability to compare things:
software,
Political options,
manufactured things,
...

The most important is to KISS (keep it simple stupid).
So hide complexity!

Use case:
So, we just start to add a new comparaison page:

This comparaison page will be the link:
www.compareit.com/MyComparaison

This new page can contain a small description in HTML to sum up what we compare 
and a list of ability which will be what we compare really on comparaison item.

Ability have a type (bool, string, number, state)
state will alow to have different state as an enum (color, day or even [N/A, started, ended, work in progress]
Best: autodetect type.

We can filter to remove all items not needed.
www.compareit.com/MyComparaison?item1=5&item2=3

and we can hide easily on a page similare ability if same on all items.


page layout:

<title1>Title</title1>

My description.....
blabla
bar <size=5>foo</size>

| 		    |	Item1  	|	Item2	|	Item3	|
| ability1	|	ok  	|	KO		|	OK		|
| ability2	|	3  		|	2		|	1		|
